An implementation of an analytical model of stationkeeping metrics. More precisely, this class numerically calculates points where the differential lateral acceleration of a starshade from the reference point of a telescope is approximately zero.

This class is based on, "Minimal differential lateral acceleration configurations for starshade stationkeeping in exoplanet direct imaging" by Jackson Kulik, Gabriel J. Soto, and Dmitry Savransky, published on 8 March 2022 in the "Journal of Astronomical Telescopes, Instruments, and Systems, Vol. 8, Issue 1."
